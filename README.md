> #### Real-World Scenario-Based Problems (Collections + I/O + Regex):
> 1. **ResumeAnalyzer** - Smart resume filtering system that reads resumes from folder, extracts contact details using regex, indexes candidates by email, and sorts by keyword match count
> 2. **TravelLog** - Trip organizer using object serialization to save/load travel experiences, search cities with regex, filter trips by duration, and track unique countries visited
> 3. **FeedbackGuru** - Survey analyzer that reads feedback files, extracts ratings with regex, categorizes feedback (Positive/Neutral/Negative) using generics and collections
> 4. **CodeRepoCleaner** - Java file scanner that analyzes code repository, detects naming violations with regex, categorizes files (Valid/Warnings/Errors), and filters by size
> 5. **ExamScanner** - Answer sheet validator that parses CSV files, validates format with regex, scores answers against answer key, and ranks students using PriorityQueue

### 24-Jan-2026: Java Reflection and Annotations
- **Java Reflection API** - Dynamic class inspection, field/method access, private member manipulation, dynamic object creation, annotation retrieval, custom object mappers, JSON generation, dependency injection, and proxy patterns (12 problems covering basic to advanced concepts)
- **Custom Annotations** - Created custom annotations with runtime retention including @LogExecutionTime, @MaxLength, @RoleAllowed, @JsonField, @CacheResult, @BugReport (repeatable), @ImportantMethod, @Todo, and @TaskInfo with practical reflection-based implementations

### 27-Jan-2026: Advanced Scenario-Based Problems (Collections + I/O + Regex)
- File I/O with BufferedReader for efficient data processing
- Regex pattern matching for data extraction and validation

- Custom exception handling for business logic
- Date parsing and validation with LocalDate
- Generic-friendly design for extensibility

> #### Advanced Real-World Problems:
> 1. **MedInventory** - Smart Hospital Inventory Tracker that reads CSV inventory files, detects expired items using regex, categorizes medical supplies by type, removes duplicates, and raises custom exceptions for critically low supplies
> 2. **ChatLogParser** - Messaging Pattern Analyzer that parses chat logs with regex, extracts timestamp/user/message, filters idle chat, stores in TreeMap for alphabetical sorting, and implements generic MessageFilter interface
> 3. **SongVault** - Personal Music Library Manager that reads song files with I/O streams, extracts fields using regex, groups by genre, maintains unique artists with Set, and supports filtering/sorting with Java Streams
> 4. **ExamResultUploader** - Bulk Marks Processing system that validates CSV data with regex, stores subject-wise marks, calculates top scorers using PriorityQueue, and throws custom exceptions for invalid formats
> 5. **DealTracker** - E-Commerce Discount Validator that parses deal files, uses regex for percentage/date extraction, filters expired deals with LocalDate, prevents duplicates with Set, and sorts by discount
