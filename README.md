### Day 6 – Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Interface & Abstract Class + Scenario-Based Problems  
**Date:** 01-Jan-2026

- Encapsulation with private fields and public methods.
- Polymorphism (compile-time and runtime).
- Interface implementation and abstract classes.
- Real-world scenario-based problem solving.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- Data hiding and encapsulation
- Method overriding for runtime polymorphism
- Interface contracts and multiple inheritance
- Abstract classes vs interfaces
- Helper methods and modular design

**Helper Methods Practice:**
- `validateUserInput()` - Input validation
- `checkLoanEligibility()` - Business logic
- `calculateDiscount()` - Mathematical operations
- Keeping methods small, focused, and reusable

**Scenario-Based Projects Completed:**

**1. Hospital Patient Management System**
- Classes: Patient, Doctor, Bill
- Interface: Payable with calculatePayment()
- Inheritance: InPatient, OutPatient extend Patient
- Polymorphism: displayInfo() for different entities
- Encapsulation: Private medicalHistory with public getSummary()

**2. Vehicle Rental Application**
- Classes: Vehicle, Bike, Car, Truck, Customer
- Interface: Rentable with calculateRent(int days)
- Inheritance: Car, Bike, Truck extend Vehicle
- Operators: baseRate × days ± surcharges
- Encapsulation: Protected vehicle attributes

**3. University Course Enrollment System**
- Classes: Student, Course, Faculty, Enrollment
- Interface: Graded with assignGrade()
- Inheritance: Undergraduate, Postgraduate extend Student
- Operators: GPA calculations
- Polymorphism: Different grading styles

**4. E-Wallet Application**
- Classes: User, Wallet, Transaction
- Interface: Transferrable with transferTo()
- Inheritance: PersonalWallet, BusinessWallet
- Encapsulation: Private balance with getBalance()
- Operators: Deductions, taxes, referral credits

**5. Smart Home Automation System**
- Classes: Appliance, Light, Fan, AC, UserController
- Interface: Controllable with turnOn(), turnOff()
- Inheritance: Device types extend Appliance
- Polymorphism: Different behaviors for each appliance
- Operators: Energy usage comparisons

### Day 7 – Advanced Scenario-Based Problems  
**Date:** 02-Jan-2026

- Deep dive into helper methods and modular code design.
- Breaking complex logic into reusable methods.
- Real-world story-driven programming problems.

**Helper Methods Best Practices:**
- Write small, focused, single-responsibility methods
- Examples: `isPalindrome(String s)`, `removeDuplicates(List<Integer> list)`
- Improve code readability and reusability
- Better testing and debugging

**Advanced Scenario Projects:**

**Example Class Structure Practice:**
- Customer class with name, ID
- Account class with balance, accountNumber
- SavingsAccount extends Account with interestRate
- CurrentAccount extends Account with overdraftLimit

**Key Learning:**
- Story-driven problem solving approach
- Integrating all OOP concepts together
- Classes, Variables, Methods, Constructors
- Access Modifiers, Interfaces, Operators
- Complete OOP Principles implementation
