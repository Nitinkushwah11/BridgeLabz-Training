# Week 6: Java 8 Programming Practice
This week focuses on the new features introduced in Java 8, including Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces. The goal is to understand how these features can be used to write more concise and readable code.


### 29-Jan-2026: Lambda Expression and Functional Interfaces
- Introduction to Lambda Expressions
- Syntax and structure of Lambda Expressions
- Functional Interfaces in Java
- Commonly used Functional Interfaces (Predicate, Function, Consumer, Supplier)

**Functional Interface:** https://github.com/Abhishek-Pandey-git/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/java8-programming-practice/java8_programming_practice/src/com/functionalinterface

**Method References:** [method references](https://github.com/Nitinkushwah11/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/java8-programming-practice/java8-programming-practice/gcr-codebase/Java8Concepts/src/com/methodreferences)

**Lambda Expressions** 👉: https://github.com/Nitinkushwah11/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/java8-programming-practice/java8-programming-practice/gcr-codebase/Java8Concepts/src/com/lambdaexpression
